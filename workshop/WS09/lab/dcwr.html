<h1>Derived Classes and Resources</h1>
Design classes with dynamically allocated resources to model the components of a programming solution<br />
Define the copy constructor and assignment operator for a derived class with a resource<br />
Identify the copy constructor and copy assignment operator defaults for a derived class<br />
"If you use pointers, you have to think about resource management" (Stroustrup, 1997)<br />
<br />
<br />
Inheritance hierarchies that access resources at multiple levels require intervention. &nbspManaging relationships between the special member functions in a hierarchy with multiple resources involves ensuring that the appropriate calls between these functions are made. &nbspThe definitions of some copy constructors and copy assignment operators in the hierarchy may require explicit coding of the connections to their base class counterparts. <br />
<br />
This chapter describes how to define the constructors and the copy assignment operators in a hierarchy that access multiple resources and how to call their base class counterparts. <br />
<br />
<br />
CONSTRUCTORS AND DESTRUCTOR<br />
<br />
Each constructor of a derived class calls a constructor of its base class. &nbspBy default, that constructor is the no-argument constructor. &nbspTo override this default, we insert an explicit call to the base class constructor. <br />
<br />
Destructors in an inheritance hierarchy do not require any intervention, since each class in the hierarchy has but one destructor and each destructor calls its sole base class counterpart automatically. <br />
<br />
Example<br />
<br />
Let us upgrade the definition of our Student class to accommodate a client-defined number of grades. &nbspWe store the grades in dynamic memory and store the address of that memory in a resource instance pointer. <br />
<br />
The upgraded definition of our Student class contains a resource instance pointer:<br />
<br />
 // Student.h<br />
<br />
 #include &lt;iostream&gt;<br />
 const int NC = 30;<br />
<br />
 class Person {<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspchar name[NC+1];<br />
 &nbsp&nbsppublic:<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPerson();<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPerson(const char*);<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspvoid display(std::ostream&) const; <br />
 };<br />
<br />
 class Student : public Person {<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspint no;<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspfloat* grade;<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspint ng;<br />
 &nbsp&nbsppublic:<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspStudent();<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspStudent(int);<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspStudent(const char*, int, const float*, int); <br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp~Student();<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspvoid display(std::ostream&) const;<br />
 };<br />
Our four-argument constructor forwards the student's name to the single-argument constructor of the base class and then allocates memory for the grades. &nbspOur destructor deallocates that memory. <br />
<br />
 // Student.cpp<br />

COPY CONSTRUCTOR<br />
<br />
The copy constructor of a derived class calls a constructor of the base class. &nbspBy default, that constructor is the no-argument constructor. &nbspTo override this default, we explicitly call the base class constructor of our choice. <br />
<br />
The header in the definition of the copy constructor for a derived class takes the form<br />
<br />
 Derived(const Derived& identifier) : Base(identifier) {<br />
<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp// ...<br />
 }<br />
The parameter receives an unmodifiable reference to an object of the derived class. &nbspThe argument in the call to the base class' constructor is the parameter's identifier. <br />
<br />
Copying occurs in two distinct stages and four steps altogether:<br />
<br />
copy the base class part of the existing object<br />
allocate memory for the instance variables of the base class in the order of their declaration<br />
execute the base class' copy constructor<br />
copy the derived class part of the existing object<br />
allocate memory for the instance variables of the derived class in the order of their declaration<br />
execute the derived class' copy constructor<br />
Example<br />
<br />
Let us declare our own definition of the copy constructor for our Student class, but use the default definition for the Person class:<br />
<br />
 // Student.h<br />
<br />
 #include &lt;iostream&gt;<br />
 const int NC = 30;<br />
<br />
 class Person {<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspchar name[NC+1];<br />
 &nbsp&nbsppublic:<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPerson();<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPerson(const char*);<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspvoid display(std::ostream&) const; <br />
 };<br />
<br />
 class Student : public Person {<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspint no;<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspfloat* grade;<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspint ng;<br />
 &nbsp&nbsppublic:<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspStudent();<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspStudent(int);<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspStudent(const char*, int, const float*, int); <br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspStudent(const Student&);<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp~Student();<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspvoid display(std::ostream&) const;<br />
 };<br />
We implement the copying steps as follows:<br />
<br />
shallow copy the Person part of the source object<br />
allocate static memory for name in the base class part of the newly created object<br />
copy into name the string at address src.name<br />
copy the Student part of the source object<br />
allocate static memory for no, *grade and ng in the derived part of the newly created object<br />
shallow copy src.no into no<br />
shallow copy src.ng into ng<br />
allocate dynamic memory for a copy of src.grade<br />
deep copy the elements at src.grade into grade<br />
The default copy constructor for the base class performs a shallow copy. &nbspThe copy constructor for the derived class calls the base class copy constructor and performs the deep copy itself:<br />

COPY ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR<br />
<br />
The default copy assignment operator of a derived class calls the copy assignment operator of its base class. &nbspHowever, any custom copy assignment operator of a derived class DOES NOT by default call the copy assignment operator of its base class. &nbspAccordingly, a custom copy assignment operator of a derived class with a resource requires an explicit call to the base class copy assignment operator.<br />
<br />
We call the base class copy assignment operator from within the body of the definition of the derived class assignment operator. &nbspThe call takes one of the following forms:<br />
<br />
the functional form<br />
the cast assignment form<br />
The functional expression takes the form<br />
<br />
 Base::operator=(identifier);<br />
The assignment expression takes the form<br />
<br />
 (Base&)*this = identifier;<br />
Base is the name of the base class and identifier is the name of the right operand, which is the source object for the assignment. &nbspNote that the address of the derived object is the same as the address of the base class part of that object. &nbspThe compiler distinguishes the call to the base class operator from a call to the derived class operator by the type of the left operand. <br />
Example<br />
<br />
The derived class definition declares the assignment operator and a private member function for the copying operations:<br />
<br />
 // Student.h<br />
<br />
 #include &lt;iostream&gt;<br />
 const int NC = 30;<br />
<br />
 class Person {<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspchar name[NC+1];<br />
 &nbsp&nbsppublic:<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPerson();<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPerson(const char*);<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspvoid display(std::ostream&) const; <br />
 };<br />
<br />
 class Student : public Person {<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspint no;<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspfloat* grade;<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspint ng;<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspvoid init(int, int, const float*);<br />
 &nbsp&nbsppublic:<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspStudent();<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspStudent(int);<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspStudent(const char*, int, const float*, int); <br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspStudent(const Student&);<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspStudent& operator=(const Student& src);<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp~Student();<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspvoid display(std::ostream&) const;<br />
 };<br />
The private init() contains the copying logic shared by the constructors and the assignment operator: <br />

Direct Call Copy Constructor<br />
<br />
The alternative to sharing a private member function is a direct call from the copy constructor to the copy assignment operator (as in the chapter entitled Classes and Resources). &nbspIn a direct call, the assignment operator copies the base class part of the object and any call to the base class copy constructor is redundant. <br />
<br />
 Student::Student(const Student& src) { // calls no-argument base constructor <br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspgrade = nullptr;<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp*this = src;<br />
 }<br />
<br />
 Student& Student::operator=(const Student& src) {<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspif (this != &src) {<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp// Base class assignment <br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp// 1 - functional expression<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp// Person::operator=(src);<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp// 2 - assignment expression<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPerson& person = *this; // only copies address<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspperson = src; &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp// call base class operator<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspdelete [] grade;<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspno = src.no;<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspng = src.ng;<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspif (src.ng &gt; 0) {<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspgrade = new float[ng];<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspfor (int i = 0; i &lt; ng; i++)<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspgrade[i] = src.grade[i];<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp}<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspelse<br />
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspgrade = nullptr;<br />

SUMMARY<br />
<br />
a derived class with a resource requires explicit definitions of its special member functions - constructors, copy assignment operator and destructor<br />
an explicitly defined derived class copy constructor without a call to the base class' copy constructor calls the base class' no-argument constructor<br />
the derived class' copy constructor executes the logic in the base class' copy constructor first<br />
an explicitly defined derived class copy assignment operator does NOT automatically call the base class assignment operator. <br />
the derived class assignment operator executes the base class assignment operator entirely within the scope of the copy derived class assignment operator<br />
the destructor of a derived class automatically calls the destructor of the base class<br />
